This repository is to solve Jane Street's puzzle (2025/01).

## Versions

### dfs.c

Solving with a DFS-based brute force algorithm.

* `-d 1`: Show matrix during specific position.
* `-v`: Verbose.

### dfs-optimize1.c

Still a DFS-based brute force algorithm, but add some optimization to bypass unnecessary recursive calls.

Benchmark can be obtained from [dfs-optimize1.txt](https://github.com/gslin/jane-street-puzzle-202501/blob/master/dfs-optimize1.txt).

* `-d 1`: Show matrix during specific position.
